            Allocates memory charges (from the overall size of memory and the paging files on disk) for the specified reserved memory pages. The

            allocated unless/until the virtual addresses are actually accessed. To reserve and commit pages in one step, call VirtualAllocEx with
            MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE. Attempting to commit a specific address range by specifying MEM_COMMIT without MEM_RESERVE and a non-NULL

            Indicates that data in the memory range specified by lpAddress and dwSize is no longer of interest. The pages should not be read from or
            written to the paging file. However, the memory block will be used again later, so it should not be decommitted. This value cannot be used
            with any other value. Using this value does not guarantee that the range operated on with MEM_RESET will contain zeros. If you want the
            range to contain zeros, decommit the memory and then recommit it. When you use MEM_RESET, the VirtualAllocEx function ignores the value of
            fProtect. However, you must still set fProtect to a valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. VirtualAllocEx returns an error if you
            use MEM_RESET and the range of memory is mapped to a file. A shared view is only acceptable if it is mapped to a paging file.

            MEM_RESET_UNDO should only be called on an address range to which MEM_RESET was successfully applied earlier. It indicates that the data in

            If the function succeeds, that means all data in the specified address range is intact. If the function fails, at least some of the data in
            the address range has been replaced with zeroes. This value cannot be used with any other value. If MEM_RESET_UNDO is called on an address
            range which was not MEM_RESET earlier, the behavior is undefined. When you specify MEM_RESET, the VirtualAllocEx function ignores the value
            of flProtect. However, you must still set flProtect to a valid protection value, such as PAGE_NOACCESS. Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows 7,
